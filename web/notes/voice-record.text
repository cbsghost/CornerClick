Voice Recorder
-----------

I've been using the simple and functional <a href="http://macupdate.com/info.php/id/8846">Audio In</a> application in conjunction with CornerClick, to make an easy to use voice recorder for taking notes.

I assigned Audio In to one of my corners, and the folder where the recordings are saved to the same corner with a different modifier set.  Then I set the view options for the Finder window to display in Column format for that folder.  When I want to record a note, I activate Audio In.  When I want to hear the old notes I can use the preview function of the finder to listen to them in place, after opening the window via CornerClick.
