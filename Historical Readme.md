Sit back and relax, and I'll tell you a tale...Just kidding.

Mostly I just wanted to describe the origins of CornerClick and
how it has evolved slowly like a single-celled organism over its
seven year history.

In the summer of 2003 I was in between jobs.  I had just finished my 
previous employment and actually wasn't sure what my future was
for a few months.  I had a job sort of lined up but nothing immediate.

I was at the time very frustrated with what I considered an obvious shortcoming
of Mac OS X: there was no quick way of switching between running Applications 
and opening things with just the mouse.  You could command-tab between applications (always
having to follow what icon was selected as you cycled through them to pick the right one.) and
you could use the Dock.  I didn't find either option very efficient.  I wondered why there
were no utilities to let you map the corners of your screen to perform useful functions.  I 
had recently read about Fitt's Law. 

Fitt's Law says that there are five pixels of the screen that are the fastest pixels to click on
no matter where your cursor is pointed.  They are:

* 1. The pixel directly under the cursor.  This is obvious, the mouse doesn't have to move to pick it.
* 2-5: the four corners of the screen.

Each corner of the screen is essentially an infinitely large target for you to hit.  The way
the mouse cursor works is that moving into (and beyond) the corner of the screen "traps" the 
cursor at exactly the corner pixel.  This means that you can quickly jam the cursor into a corner
and know that it will settle in exactly one location.

Why not put buttons in those locations?

Great I was ready to start coding.  Except I didn't know Objective-C or any Cocoa. I had to start
learning from nothing.  I had nothing else to work on, so eventually I created CornerClick.

Since then I've added useful features and mashed down bugs that popped up.  Once I began 
working full time again it became harder to get time to update CornerClick, but I managed
to keep the project abreast of new Mac OS X versions as they came out.

I realized I needed to make this project Open-Source so that outstanding bugs and features might
at least be addressed by somebody else.  It took a looong time to get to doing this, but I think it is 
finally a good time to make the source available.  Github is a great place to have coding become social, and so I think it will be a good place for CornerClick to go.

By making it free as in speech as well as in beer, I'm essentially donating it to you.  I will perhaps
at times add features/bugfixes at (at a glacial pace I'm sure), but I am essentially leading it onto the iceberg for a goodbye. 

Bye.
